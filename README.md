## Task :man_technologist:
For this assignment, we were tasked with creating a command line application using Node.js. The purpose of the application is to generate a README based on user inputs.

The generator can be invoked by using the command: 

```bash
node index.js
```

Once invoked, the command line will the user ask a series of questions that will inquire (see what I did there?...) about what the user wants included in their README.

## Thoughts and Notes :thinking:
This assignment was very interesting. Node and the command line are very powerful frameworks to utilize. From creating a file to taking in user input, I would have never thought I could do anything like that beforehand.
